        <p>A phenomenal singer and songwriter. His career started in the 1960's and he's still going strong today.</p>
        <p>As well as producing and arranging albums for other artists, he has released 51 top 40 singles including "Could It Be Magic", "Mandy" and "I Write The Songs".</p>
        <h3 id="headline">Although, Barry has never admited to having any plastic surgery, key dates of changes in his appearance are listed below.</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1987</strong> Changes in his appearance are linked to weight lose rather than surgery.</li>
          <li><strong>1994</strong> His cheeks start to look unnaturally full. Could this be due to botox?</li>
          <li><strong>1998</strong> Those full cheeks are looking more natural again, perhaps the botox had worn off.</li>
          <li><strong>2000's</strong> Barry was looking slightly lumpy, had he started using Botox injections again?</li>
          <li><strong>2003</strong> Barry made headlines for reportedly getting both an upper and lower facelift to tighten his facial skin and remove drooping skin from around his eyes. As well as surgery to repair a broken nose, which, happened when he repotedly "walked into a wall"!</li>
          <li><strong>2008</strong> Barry's face is looking suspiciously smooth for a 65 year old, but he continues to insist he just looks good for his age!</li>
          <li><strong>2013</strong> Focus moved to his eyelids, to remove excess skin.</li>
          <li><strong>2014</strong> It was assumed that the singers taut facial appearance was due to further use of dermal fillers.</li>
          <li><strong>2017</strong> Although, Barry's face still shows signs of using botox, he seems to have found a new technician. The affects are looking slightly more natural. However, he still appears incredibly smooth faced for a 73 year old man.</li>
        </ul>
